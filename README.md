# 100 Python Project Challenge

## Overview
The **100 Python Project Challenge** is an ambitious program designed for a team of quantitative finance undergraduates. The goal is to complete one Python project at a time, progressively increasing in complexity and length. This challenge enhances coding skills and deepens understanding of quantitative finance concepts, culminating in a portfolio-worthy capstone project.

## Structure

### Project Progression
- **Code Length:** Each project increases by 10±1 lines of code.
- **Complexity:** Projects start simple and gradually incorporate more advanced topics and techniques.

### Milestone Challenges
- **Every 10 Projects:** A significant increase in difficulty, introducing new mandatory challenges such as:
  - Advanced data analysis and visualization.
  - Machine learning algorithms.
  - Financial modeling and simulations.
  - Optimization techniques.

### Capstone Projects
- **Final 10 Projects:** These are designed to be comprehensive and portfolio-worthy, showcasing the skills and knowledge acquired throughout the challenge.
- **Focus Areas:** 
  - Real-world financial data analysis.
  - Development of trading algorithms.
  - Risk management models.
  - Portfolio optimization.

## Example Progression and Timelines

- **Project 1:** Basic data manipulation with pandas (10 lines) - **Estimated Time: 1 ± 2 days**.
- **Project 2:** Simple financial calculations (20 lines) - **Estimated Time: 2 ± 2 days**.
- **Project 10:** Implementing a basic trading strategy (100 lines) - **Estimated Time: 10 ± 2 days (approximately 1.5 weeks)**.
- **Project 20:** Developing a machine learning model for stock price prediction (200 lines) - **Estimated Time: 20 ± 2 days (approximately 3 weeks)**.
- **Project 90:** Creating a comprehensive risk management system (900 lines) - **Estimated Time: 90 ± 2 days (approximately 13 weeks or 3 months)**.
- **Project 100:** Capstone project - Full-scale portfolio management system (1,000 lines) - **Estimated Time: 100 ± 2 days (approximately 14 weeks or 3.5 months)**.

## Goals
- **Skill Development:** Enhance Python programming skills and apply them to quantitative finance.
- **Knowledge Application:** Integrate theoretical knowledge with practical coding experience.
- **Portfolio Building:** Create a portfolio of projects that demonstrate proficiency and expertise in quantitative finance and Python programming.

## Outcome
By the end of the 100-project challenge, participants will have a robust portfolio of projects, showcasing their ability to tackle complex problems in quantitative finance using Python. This experience will be invaluable for future academic pursuits and career opportunities in the field.
